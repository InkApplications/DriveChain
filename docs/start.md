Getting Started
===============

Requirements
------------

### Dagger2

Dagger is a core component of DriveChain. If you are not already using it
follow [The Dagger2 User's Guide].

[The Dagger2 User's Guide]:https://google.github.io/dagger/users-guide.html

### Support Library

DriveChain is designed to be used with applications that use the Android
Support Libary. It is expected that Activities and Fragments extend the
AppCompat versions of standard Android classes.

### Kotlin

Kotlin is not an explicit requirement, but it is highly recommended.
DriveChain is written entirely in Kotlin for Kotlin. There's no reason
it can't be used with Java applications, however it is not explicitly 
supported by the framework.

Installation / Setup
--------------------

### Existing Applications

If you already have an application and want to add DriveChain to it,
follow the [Existing App Setup Guide].

### New Applications

Download our Base Application as a template (Coming Soon) or follow
the [Existing App Setup Guide] on a standard Android project.
